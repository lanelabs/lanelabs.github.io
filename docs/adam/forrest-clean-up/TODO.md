# Forest Clean Up TODO

- Review current observation lines and generate a larger pool of high-quality wonder + quirky variations.
- Review the surprise system and make surprise events more noticeable to players in moment-to-moment gameplay.
- Fix and stabilize the build/place system UX and interaction flow.
- Rework build mode and placement interaction, then re-enable the in-game build icon/menu.
- Add more interactivity and discovery mechanics tied to ponds and streams.
