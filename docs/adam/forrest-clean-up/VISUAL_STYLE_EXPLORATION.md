# Visual Style Exploration (2026-02-27)

This document captures visual directions for the Forrest Clean Up game. The goal is a consistent, simple, cozy style inspired by games like RimWorld: clean shapes, readable silhouettes, and a deliberate color story.

## Shared Style Goals
- Simple, consistent shapes with clean outlines.
- Readable silhouettes at a glance.
- Cozy, low-contrast palette with warm highlights.
- Minimal visual noise; the forest should feel calm.
- Clear interactive affordances (glow, pulse, or slight scale).

## Direction A: "Paper Cutout Forest"
**Core idea:** Flat shapes, soft shadow, paper-like texture.  
**Look:** Slightly desaturated greens with warm accents; simple trunk + canopy shapes.  
**How it would feel:** Handmade and cozy, like layered paper.

**Style rules**
- Trees: two-layer canopy (big, medium), simple trunk rectangle.
- Litter: small flat icons with a single shadow.
- Animals: rounded blobs with tiny ears/tails, minimal facial detail.

**Palette (example)**
- Ground: #84B07E
- Canopy: #5E9B6A / #4F7F5D
- Trunk: #6C4D2B
- Accent: #F2C14E
- UI panel: #F6FFF4

## Direction B: "Rimwood Minimal"
**Core idea:** RimWorld-like clean geometry and muted contrast.  
**Look:** Balanced colors, soft outlines, clear layers.  
**How it would feel:** Clean and readable with a calm, systemic vibe.

**Style rules**
- Trees: triangle canopy, rectangle trunk, 2–3 fixed sizes.
- Litter: small icon set with consistent stroke width.
- Ponds: flat oval with 2-tone highlight ring.

**Palette (example)**
- Ground: #7FAE7A
- Canopy: #4D8A5A
- Trunk: #6B4A2A
- Water: #6FA7C7
- Accent: #E8B04A

## Direction C: "Storybook Pastel"
**Core idea:** Softer colors, rounder shapes, gentle gradients.  
**Look:** Pastel palette with subtle shading and warm highlights.  
**How it would feel:** Wholesome, kid-friendly, exploratory.

**Style rules**
- Trees: round canopy circles; short, wide trunks.
- Litter: small rounded shapes with a soft border.
- Animals: circle heads + oval bodies.

**Palette (example)**
- Ground: #9CCFA3
- Canopy: #7DBF89 / #6BAE7A
- Trunk: #7A5A3B
- Water: #8BB7D9
- Accent: #F4C95D

## Direction D: "Forest Quilt"
**Core idea:** Chunky stitched shapes, visible texture, warm earth.  
**Look:** Patchwork vibe; a touch of texture on every surface.  
**How it would feel:** Tactile and comforting.

**Style rules**
- Trees: chunky canopy with a simple stitch line.
- Litter: tiny stitched icons.
- UI: stitched border, soft shadows.

**Palette (example)**
- Ground: #7EAD79
- Canopy: #5A8F64
- Trunk: #6A4B2D
- Water: #6E9FC0
- Accent: #E0B255

## Interaction Style Suggestions
- Hover: soft glow + slight scale (1.04x).
- Placement preview: semi-transparent + green/red tint.
- Important moments: gentle pulse (not flashing).

## Recommendation
Start with **Direction B (Rimwood Minimal)** for consistency with the RimWorld inspiration, then soften it with slightly warmer tones from Direction A for coziness.

## Next Step Decision
Pick a direction (A–D). I can then:
- Update drawing rules.
- Define a full palette.
- Refactor sprites to match the selected style.
