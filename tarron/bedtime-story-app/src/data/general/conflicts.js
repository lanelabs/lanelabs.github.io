// Conflicts: opposition, tension, and struggle. Things that pit characters
// against each other, against society, or against impossible odds. Should be
// genre-neutral — vague enough to fit fantasy, sci-fi, or modern, but specific
// enough to provide real creative constraint for a story.
//
// TEMPLATE FIT — must be a noun phrase starting with "A/An" or "Something/Two".
// Auto-computed forms:
//   {hook}      → "a broken promise"  (default, with article)
//   {hook.bare} → "broken promise"    (article stripped)
//
// To add custom forms, convert to an object:
//   BEFORE: 'A broken promise'
//   AFTER:  { full: 'A broken promise', involving: 'involving a broken promise' }
//
// Each entry should be ONE specific conflict — never combine with "or"
// (split into separate entries instead).
