// Mysteries: unknowns, puzzles, and things that demand discovery. Things that
// make you ask "what's going on?" — unexplained phenomena, missing pieces,
// hidden truths waiting to be uncovered. Should be genre-neutral — vague enough
// to fit fantasy, sci-fi, or modern, but specific enough to spark curiosity
// and anchor a story.
//
// TEMPLATE FIT — must be a noun phrase starting with "A/An" or "Something".
// Auto-computed forms (shared with conflicts as {hook}):
//   {hook}      → "a forbidden secret"  (default, with article)
//   {hook.bare} → "forbidden secret"    (article stripped)
//
// To add custom forms, convert to an object:
//   BEFORE: 'A forbidden secret'
//   AFTER:  { full: 'A forbidden secret', involving: 'involving a forbidden secret' }
//
// Each entry should be ONE specific mystery — never combine with "or"
// (split into separate entries instead).
