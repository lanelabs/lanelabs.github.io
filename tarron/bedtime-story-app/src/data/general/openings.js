// Openings: creative constraints for how to START the story. These combine
// opening scenes (what's happening), techniques (how to tell it), and starting
// situations (what the status quo is before the conflict). Each should work as
// a standalone prompt that shapes how the storyteller begins — WITHOUT hinting
// at the conflict or mystery (those have their own lists) and WITHOUT locking
// in a specific setting or genre.
export const openings = [
  // Opening scenes — what kind of moment to start with
  'A quiet moment alone',
  'A group gathered together',
  'Someone arriving somewhere new',
  'A celebration or festival',
  'Someone waking up',
  'Someone saying goodbye',
  'Two characters meeting for the first time',
  'Someone watching from a distance',
  'A meal being shared',
  'Someone practicing or training',
  'Someone lost',
  'A journey already underway',

  // Opening techniques — how to tell the beginning
  'A question the character is asking themselves',
  'A vivid sound or smell',
  'Dialogue — someone mid-conversation',
  'In the middle of the action',
  'The character describing their favorite thing',
  'A small, specific detail that hints at something bigger',
  'What the character sees right now',
  'The character doing something they do every day',

  // Starting situations — the status quo before the conflict
  'Everything has been peaceful for a long time',
  'A big day everyone has been preparing for',
  'An ordinary day — nothing special at all',
  'Things have been slowly getting worse',
  'Someone just accomplished something important',
  'A new season or change is in the air',
  'A long wait is finally over',
  'The character is about to leave home',
  'A rumor has been spreading',
  'An old routine is about to be broken',
