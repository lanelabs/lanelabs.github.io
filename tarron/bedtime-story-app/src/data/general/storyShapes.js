// Story shapes: the structural backbone of the plot — what kind of story it
// is. This is distinct from conflict/mystery (the specific tension) and from
// tone (how it feels). Story shape tells you the arc: "a quest" means
// someone is going after something; "an unlikely friendship" means two
// characters who shouldn't get along end up bonding. Should be short phrases
// starting with "A..." or a verb phrase that names the plot pattern.
