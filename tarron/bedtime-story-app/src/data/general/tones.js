// Tones: the overall mood or atmosphere of the story. This is NOT what happens
// (that's conflict/mystery) or what the lesson is (that's moral) — it's how
// the story feels. A "silly" story about a stolen treasure plays completely
// differently than a "spooky" one. Should be single words or short phrases
// that a storyteller can immediately channel.
