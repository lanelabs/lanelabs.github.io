# Template Inspiration

One-line rough ideas pulled from book blurbs, story structures,
opening techniques, and tension mechanics research. Each is a
candidate to develop into a full template. Not all will work —
the point is variety and sparking combinations.

Notation: {placeholders} show where story elements would go.
Lines marked * would need new placeholder forms or data.


## FROM BOOK BLURB PATTERNS

The "But" Pivot — ordinary setup shattered by one word
> {Character1} had a perfectly ordinary life in {setting}. But {hook}.

The Question Hook — open a curiosity gap
> What if {hook} wasn't a problem — but a gift?

The Catalog of Wonders — list of vivid details before narrative
> {Item}. {Setting.bare}. {Weather}. And in the middle of it all, {character1.emotional}.

The Unlikely Hero — smallness contrasted with bigness
> {Character1.emotional} is the last person you'd expect to face {hook}. And yet.

The Anti-Blurb / Warning — reverse psychology
> This is not a gentle story. But then, neither is {character1.emotional}.

The Emotional Promise — feeling over plot
> A {tone} story about two characters who discover that {moral.about} changes everything.

The Fairy-Tale Subversion — set up a trope, break it
> Once upon a time, {character1} rescued {character2}. Actually, it was the other way around.

The "What If" Premise — one impossible thing, stated plainly
> What if {hook} only happened in {setting}? And what if {character1.emotional} was the only one who noticed?

The Snowball — one thing leads to another leads to chaos
> It started with {opening}. Then {hook}. Then {item} showed up. Now {character1.emotional} and {character2} are in the middle of {storyShape}.

The Withholding Blurb — hint but don't explain
> Something is wrong in {setting}. {Character1.emotional} knows it. {Character2} knows it. Neither will say what.


## FROM STORY STRUCTURE FRAMEWORKS

Kishotenketsu (no conflict) — surprise recontextualization
> {Character1.emotional} and {character2} in {setting}, {weather}. Nothing goes wrong. But something shifts — and afterward, nothing looks quite the same.

Voyage and Return — wonder then homecoming
> {Character1.emotional} leaves {setting} and enters somewhere new. What starts as wonder becomes {hook}. {Item} is the only way back.

Rebirth — darkness to sudden light
> {Character1.emotional} has been trapped by {hook} for as long as they can remember. Then {character2} arrives in {setting} with {item}.

The Story Spine — "because of that" chain
> Once upon a time, {character1.emotional} lived in {setting}. Every day, {opening}. But one day, {hook}. Because of that, {item}. Because of that, {storyShape}.

Circular — ends where it began
> It begins in {setting}. It ends there, too. But between {opening} and {hook}, everything about {character1.emotional} and {character2} changes.

~~Wind-Down — energy narrows toward sleep~~ → **Used in Template 11** (combined with Direct Address)
> ~~{Weather}, {setting} grows quiet. {Character1.emotional} and {character2} settle into {opening}. Even {hook} feels far away now. {Item} rests nearby. Tomorrow, {storyShape}. Tonight, just {tone.noun}.~~

Man in Hole — things get worse, then better
> In {setting}, things were fine — until {hook}. {Character1.emotional} and {character2} fall deep. But {item} and {storyShape} pull them back up.

Overcoming the Monster — courage vs. overwhelming odds
> Something terrible has come to {setting}: {hook}. Only {character1.emotional} and {character2} stand between it and everything they care about.

Rags to Riches — from nothing to everything
> {Character1.emotional} had nothing but {item}. In {setting}, {weather}, that turned out to be enough.

The Fool Triumphant — underestimated character wins
> Nobody expected {character1.emotional} to solve {hook}. Not even {character2}. Especially not in {setting}.


## FROM OPENING TECHNIQUE PATTERNS

~~Legend Frame — "they say"~~ → **Used in Template 8** (combined with Believer vs. Skeptic)
> ~~They say that in {setting}, {weather}, {hook} happens once a generation. {Character1.emotional} and {character2} are about to find out if it's true.~~

~~Rule to Be Broken — prohibition stated~~ → **Used in Template 10**
> ~~The rule in {setting} was simple: never touch {item}. {Character1.emotional} wasn't good with rules.~~

"Everyone Knows" — common knowledge, quietly wrong
> Everyone in {setting} knew {hook} was impossible. {Character1.emotional} wasn't so sure.

Interrupted Routine — pattern broken
> Every day, {character1} did the same thing in {setting}. Until the day {character2.emotional} arrived with {item}.

Impossible Image — surreal and matter-of-fact
> {Weather}, the {setting.bare} turned upside down. Not figuratively. {Character1.emotional} and {character2} noticed at the same time.

~~Dialogue Cold Open — voice before scene~~ → **Used in Template 12** (combined with Fragile Alliance)
> ~~"Don't touch that." {Character1.emotional} said it too late. {Character2} already had {item}.~~

Scalar Shift — zoom from vast to tiny (or reverse)
> Somewhere in the {setting.bare}, {weather}, smaller than anyone would notice, {item} began to glow. {Character1.emotional} noticed.

Sensory Opening — a sound or smell first
> The sound came first — {weather}. Then the smell of {setting.bare}. By the time {character1.emotional} saw {character2}, {hook} had already begun.

False Start — narrator corrects themselves
> This is a story about {character1}. Actually, no. This is a story about {character2.emotional} and how {item} changed everything.

Seasonal/Cyclical — anchored in natural time
> It was the kind of {weather} that only comes once a year. In {setting}, {character1.emotional} and {character2} both knew what it meant.

~~Direct Address — speaking to the listener~~ → **Used in Template 11** (combined with Wind-Down)
> ~~If you'd been standing in {setting} that night, {weather}, you'd have seen {character1.emotional} and {character2} staring at {item}. And you'd have wondered the same thing they did.~~

Origin Myth — creation scale
> Before anyone lived in {setting}, there was {item}. This is the story of how {character1.emotional} and {character2} found it — and what happened next.


## FROM TENSION MECHANICS

~~Reluctant Hero — the one who doesn't want to help~~ → **Used in Template 9**
> ~~{Character1.emotional} wants nothing to do with {hook}. But in {setting}, they're the only one who can help — and {character2} is counting on them.~~

Impossible Choice — two paths, both costly
> In {setting}, {character1.emotional} faces {hook}. Help {character2}, or protect what they have. They can't do both.

Ticking Clock — deadline forces action
> {Weather}, something is changing in {setting}. {Character1.emotional} doesn't have long. {Hook} — and if they don't act, everything changes.

Secret About to Surface — dread of exposure
> {Character1.emotional} has been hiding something. In {setting}, {weather}, the truth is about to come out — and {character2} is the one who'll find it.

~~Fragile Alliance — need without trust~~ → **Used in Template 12** (combined with Dialogue Cold Open)
> ~~{Character1} and {character2.emotional} have every reason not to trust each other. But {hook} in {setting} means they have to try.~~

Scarcity — the last of something

~~Believer vs. Skeptic — worldview collision~~ → **Used in Template 8** (combined with Legend Frame)

Mismatch / Dramatic Irony — character contradicts situation
> {Character1.emotional} — facing {hook}. In {setting}. {Weather}. It would be funny if it weren't so serious.

The Promise — a vow at stake
> {Character1.emotional} made a promise: {moral}. Keeping it in {setting}, with {hook} bearing down, might cost everything.

The Emotional Wound — past pain makes this harder
> For {character1.emotional}, {hook} isn't just a problem — it's the same thing that went wrong last time. And this time, {character2} is watching.

~~The "Must" Verb — obligation and reluctance compressed~~ → **Absorbed into Template 9**
> ~~{Character1.emotional} must face {hook} in {setting}. Not because they want to — because {character2} can't.~~

Voice as Hook — personality of the telling
> Listen — {character1.emotional} didn't plan any of this. Nobody plans for {hook}. But here they are, in {setting}, {weather}, with nothing but {item} and {character2}.


## COMBINATION IDEAS (mixing multiple inspirations)

Legend + Scarcity + Wind-Down
> They say {item} is the last of its kind. {Weather}, in {setting}, {character1.emotional} holds it carefully. {Character2} watches. {Hook} feels far away tonight.

Question Hook + Impossible Choice + Fairy-Tale
> Once upon a time, {character1.emotional} had to choose: face {hook} or leave {setting} behind forever. {Character2} waited to see which they'd pick.

~~Dialogue Cold Open + Fragile Alliance + Ticking Clock~~ → **Used in Template 12**
> ~~"We don't have much time." {Character1} and {character2.emotional} barely know each other. But {hook} is coming to {setting}, and {item} is all they've got.~~

Interrupted Routine + Mismatch + Cinderella Arc
> Every day in {setting}, {character1.emotional} did the same thing. Then {character2} showed up with {hook} — and nothing was the same. But somehow, it was better.

Catalog + Reluctant Hero + Three-Beat
> {Item}. {Setting.bare}. {Hook}. {Character1.emotional} wanted no part of it. {Character2} needed all of it. {Weather}, something had to give.

Sensory + Wind-Down + Lullaby Feel
> {Weather}. The {setting.bare} smells like rain. {Character1.emotional} and {character2} are done with {hook} for now. {Item} is safe. Tomorrow brings {storyShape}. Tonight, just rest.

Warning + Anti-Fairy-Tale + Secret
> This isn't the kind of story where {character1} saves {character2.emotional}. For one thing, nobody asked to be saved. For another, {hook} is {character1}'s fault — and {item} is the proof.

Origin Myth + Scarcity + Bookend
> Before there was {setting}, there was {item}. {Character1.emotional} and {character2} are the only ones who remember. {Hook} threatens to erase even that. But {item} endures.
